The CHEERS Statement is intended to be used for any form of health economic evaluation. This includes analyses that strictly examine cost outputs (i.e., cost analysis, sometimes (mis)labeled “cost-benefit” analysis) or that examine both costs and consequences. These include analyses that consider health consequences (e.g., cost-effectiveness/utility analyses [CEAs/CUAs], cost-minimization, cost-benefit/benefit-cost [CBAs]), and/or broader measures of benefit and harm to individuals (e.g., extended cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit/benefit-cost), including measures of equity (e.g., distributional cost-effectiveness analyses). 

The primary audiences for the CHEERS Statement are researchers reporting economic evaluations and the editors and peer reviewers assessing them for publication. While they are not intended to guide the conduct of economic evaluation, familiarity with reporting requirements will be useful for analysts when planning studies. 

The 2022 CHEERS Statement (Checklist, and Explanation and Elaboration Document) replaces the 2013 CHEERS Statement, which should no longer be used. The new CHEERS Statement contains 28 Items.  Please record a response for each item in the checklist below, and you can generate and download a report of your completed checklist in Word or PDF format.
